# PokePÃ©dia

A Site about Pokemon GO

## How to Run

First of all you need to have `node` and `npm` installed on your computer.

`node >= 12.x`  
`npm >= 6.x`

Run `npm` to install the dependencies,  
Now run `gulp watch` to initialize the localhost.

Or case you ***don't want*** to do all this just open the index.html in *`src/index.html`*, but the site may not work properly.

### Gulp

Gulp tasks:
- "sass" - makes all `.scss` in css minified
- "watch" - initialize a localhost, and listen to all css, js, html and css files.

## DevDependencies
- autoprefixer
- browser-sync
- cssnano
- gulp
- gulp-concat
- gulp-postcss
- gulp-rename
- gulp-sass
- postcss
- sass
